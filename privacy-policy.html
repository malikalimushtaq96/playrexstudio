            services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you
            on the Services. We also do not control the privacy policies and your privacy settings on third-party sites,

            We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
            destruction of information we hold and undertake reasonable security measures with appropriate
            confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections. However, since no software or storage system is
